Capacity Factor (CF) is defined as the actual electricity produced by an energy system over the total
capacity of the system for a given period. CF can be calculated for any electricity
generation sources using both AC and DC sizes and is used as a metric to analyze
the efficiency of different energy systems. 

Figure shows the variation in CF for different Solar Photovoltaic (SP) system sizes in different
regions of Nova Scotia in 2019. On average, larger SP systems have a higher CF. SP system
installations in Digby, Yarmouth, Shelburne and Colchester counties are relatively
smaller compared to Halifax county and CF is also lower.
