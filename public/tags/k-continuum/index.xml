      <description>Answer:The use of Data visualization to better represent data or a concept has been a crucial component of my academic life. I have written several research papers during my undergraduate and graduate studies. I used software, such as STATA (for continuous and discrete data), GRETL and EViews (for time series data) and Excel. Moreover, I took a course in software R which focused primarily on data visualizations. In R, I have expertise in using packages such as “ggplot”, “plotly”, “gganimate”, “gifski” and “googleVis” to name a few.</description>
