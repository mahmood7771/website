      <description>Throughout my academic and professional career, I have gained expertise in collecting data fromvarious sources, analyzing, writing, and presenting summarized reports to executive boards using tools such as PowerPoint, R Markdown and Tableau. I have also developed strong programming and analytical skillsusing software such as Stata, R, and EViews to produce high-quality economic research.
I recently graduated with a Master of Arts degree in Economics from Dalhousie University, where Ihave conducted research, both qualitative and quantitative as evident in my graduate thesis.</description>
