      <description>Purchasing power parity is an economic theory which states that in the presence of international trade, the price of a single good will be the same across countries under certain assumptions. The log specification is as follows:\[\begin{equation}\text{p}_t (\text{j}) = p_t^* (\text{j}) + \text{S}_t\end{equation}\]
where p\(_t\)(j) is the price of good j, p\(_t^*\) (j) price of the same good (j) and \(_t\) is the nominal exchange rate. The relationship that we are interested in incorporates all traded and non-traded goods and the equation is:\[\begin{equation}\log \hat{\text{S}} = \log\hat{\text{P}}_t^D - \log \text{P}_t^F\end{equation}\]where \(\hat{\text{P}}_t^{D}\) is domestic price level, \(\text{P}_t^F\) is foreign price level and \(\hat{\text{S}}\) is nominal exchange rate.</description>
