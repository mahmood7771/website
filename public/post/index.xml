      <description>Answer:The use of Data visualization to better represent data or a concept has been a crucial component of my academic life. I have written several research papers during my undergraduate and graduate studies. I used software, such as STATA (for continuous and discrete data), GRETL and EViews (for time series data) and Excel. Moreover, I took a course in software R which focused primarily on data visualizations. In R, I have expertise in using packages such as “ggplot”, “plotly”, “gganimate”, “gifski” and “googleVis” to name a few.</description>

      <description>These plots are some of the figures I used in my graduate thesis. For more informatation: DEMAND FOR RESIDENTIAL SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS: EVIDENCE FROM NOVA SCOTIA
Figure 1 depicts the number of SP system installations in NS from 2016 to 2019. Rebate of $1/Watt was introduced in 2018 and the total numberof installations in 2018 was 78 compared to 33 in 2017. While rebate decreased to$0.85/Watt on March 26, 2019, the total number of installations increased.</description>

      <description>Capacity Factor (CF) is defined as the actual electricity produced by an energy system over the totalcapacity of the system for a given period. CF can be calculated for any electricitygeneration sources using both AC and DC sizes and is used as a metric to analyzethe efficiency of different energy systems.
Figure shows the variation in CF for different Solar Photovoltaic (SP) system sizes in differentregions of Nova Scotia in 2019.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning: Support Vector Machines</title>

      <description>Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were designed to solve pattern classification problems such as optimal character recognition and face identification etc. but the application spread to function approximation, Geo and Environmental Sciences etc.
There are three main problems in machine learning, viz. Classification, Regression and Density Estimation. In all these cases the main goal is to learn a function (or hypothesis) from the training data.
